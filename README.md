# Inventory-Prediction-and-Sales-Forecasting

# 📦 Inventory Prediction and Sales Forecasting

This project focuses on building predictive models for **inventory management** and **sales forecasting**. By leveraging historical sales data, the goal is to forecast product demand, optimize stock levels, and reduce both shortages and overstocking.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Demand Forecasting**: Predict future sales using time-series and machine learning models.
- **Inventory Optimization**: Recommend reorder levels to balance cost and availability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify sales patterns, seasonality, and trends.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Compare models using RMSE, MAPE, and accuracy measures.

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and outliers
   - Aggregate sales at product and time level
2. **Exploratory Analysis**
   - Trend and seasonality detection
   - Correlation between products and categories
3. **Modeling**
   - Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)
   - Regression & ML-based Demand Prediction
4. **Evaluation**
   - Compare forecasts using RMSE, MAE, and MAPE
   - Visual inspection of forecast accuracy
5. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Serve predictions via API or dashboard

---

## 📈 Results
- Improved demand prediction accuracy compared to naive baseline.
- Identified **seasonal spikes** and **slow-moving products**.
- Provided actionable insights for **inventory restocking**.
